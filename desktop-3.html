             To determine the best league is a rhetorical question, as multiple metrics can be 
             is used to define the best league. The data story evaluates the best teagues 
             based on these metrics: Physical Aspects, Overall League Rating, Wages, Youth

          This is to say every country has a different style of play. It was observed in the African continent that the average strength and height of the players is higher than in America or Spain.
           This implies that each country adapts to a style of play that matches everyone's playing style. This same logic is applied in leagues where multiple clubs are present with the number of diversities,
            and the playing style is profoundly impacted. The maps explain the dataset's players in context to their nationality and the nationality ratings. We can see countries with similar ratings next to each other. 
            This is observed in the case of Europe. The League averages listed in the majority are similar to their countries. The impact of club and league level football affects the national ranking or rating. 
          Thereby when League is famous, then the countries popularity ranking.

              The Overall Rating of the leagues shows that the average rating of the players across multiple league this is considered a critical evaluation metric. 
              This means that the higher the rating, the better the quality of the players in the league. This one of the most outspoken fact of when it comes to football.
              From the graph, it can be deduced that the ITALIAN SERIE A  is the best league when taken into consideration across all position and years, but this varies based on the position and age as 
              The Spanish league has been found to have a better average for midfielder above 33. The highest average amount midfielder was found in SERIE A in 2019, meanwhile the lowest was found in 2022.To our 
              suprise Midfielder were the highest average among the 23-32 age. Barclays Premier League has the higest value of the average value among the teams in the graph. This can be seen through the tool tip, this result was observed across all years. This means all the clubs in the 
              Barclays Premier League is very competitive have atleast a squad of 9 million value which is most among all leagues , thereby it is safe to infer that every team has high rated players there allowing the league to be competative.

              Money is the driving factor for players joining clubs that can afford high wages. Thus leagues having higher quality players are better leagues as the clubs can afford to pay them.
              The sum of the wages per week was calculated along with details like average wages, and the maximum salary paid is also displayed. It can be inferred that the Barclays Premier League is best in terms of wages paid per week.
              It can also be inferred from the tooltip that the average wages paid by the clubs for players are relatively higher than in other leagues from 2016 to 2022. It can be derived that most of the leagues
              followed a similar trend pattern till 2019. There has been an apparent increase in the wages paid to the youth player (below 21) this observed in all the leagues. But this can be rebutted in the case of a specific position
              SERIE A was seen to have higher expenditure than Premier League for players aged above 33 from 2019 to 2021. The major contributor to the wage is the player between 22 and 32. This shows the age where plays 
              earn the most amount of wages. There has also been a clear shift in the players above 33 who have started making more wages that have always shown a positive trend from 2019. Barclays Premier League had the highest wage
              amount of $35,310, 450 there is an almost 20 million dollar difference between the second-highest, SERIE A  and Barclays Premier League.

              Leagues play a pivotal role in developing young players clubs as clubs invest vast amounts of money in their youth academy to develop promising young players who can be integrated into the main team,
             thereby reducing the money spent on the transfer of high-quality players. Leagues with a good quality of high potential players who can become famous players lead to better popularity and league value.
             From the heatmap, it can be deduced that Portuguese LIGA, ITALY SERIE A and German Bundesliga has the best overall record for producing high quality player , the Portuguese LIGA league produced
             good number of high potential defenders. The highest potential for midfielder was produced by Spanish Premeria League but the Italian SERIE A produced a consistent number of high quality players of Forward
             and Goalkeeper position belong to the age of 17 to 21. In overall context the league SERIE A has produced the most highquality players followed by Portuguese LIGA.

              Work Rate is an essential factor that decides the league's mentality in training and becoming better to be the best from the rest. Leagues with high work rate player composition 
              were found to be due to high value and wage bills. In general, the increased work player was increasing in percentage in all the leagues from 2017 to 2022. The increased work rate shift was mainly observed in the
              youth player (below 21) and players that have not reached the peak of their career or reached the peak (between 22 to 32) across the years. The highest top 3 average was observed in the 2017 with all 
              player from FC Barcelona in the Spanish Primera League.The leagues with high rated players and wages had the highest work rate. The Barclays Premier League,German Bundesliga, Italian SERIE A were found to have the highest work rate. The players past their prime had reduced work rates in top value leagues but had relatively higher work rates in the lower leagues. 
              It was found consistently that MLS and Bundesliga 2 League had most of the increased work rate players above 33. Barclays Perimer league and MLS was the most consistent league in terms of the top 3 rating as it was ranked the

              The heatmap identifies and understands the top 3 players from different leagues based on year and position to compare the top 3 players of each league and sort the league based on the average of the three players.
              This distribution in the quality of top 3 players based on the Leagues. It can be inferred from the graph that the EFL Two had lower-rated players as they were ranked the least every year and positioned across all 
              age groups. The French League was the Italian SERIA A had the most consistent rating for players above 33 across different positions. The players in their prime age and developing age that is between 22 and 32 
              preferred playing in Barclays Premier League as the Barclays Premier League has the highest wage bill meaning the players moved to look to get paid well. The top player in the Barclays Premier League  
              looked to play in either Spanish Premier League or German Bundesliga. Though historically it was found that older forwards generally did not play in Barclays Premier League but with a top-rated player like L.Messi and 
              Cristiano Rolando moved to Paris Saint-German and Manchester United Respectively in 2022. It has caused French League 1 and Barclays Premier League to have the highest rating for the year 2022. The top youth player
